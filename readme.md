# Web Chat Application
## State
Not functionnal yet. Paused (working on the front-end while learning react and I will come back later to the back end and this project).

In the database miniproject, I am able to register new users, to 'login' them (retrieve the username and password and checks that it correspond to a given password), to remove a user, to create a new conversation, to add a new message, to get a message from a conversation.
In the express-test miniproject, I am able to send an html file to a client, to get cookie informations.
